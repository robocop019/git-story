All that I want is to wake up fine.
Tell me that I'm alright, that I ain't gonna die.
All that I want is a hole in the ground; you can tell me when it's alright for me to come out.
Gonna make you wonder why you even try, gonna take you down and laugh when you cry.
Walking around with my little rain cloud hanging over my head.
